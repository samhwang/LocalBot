Description:
Our project is about a new way to explore the world. 
First, it will take a picture of the location you need to know about, or just any new places.
Then, the app will determine your location.
After that, it wiill try to locate the nearest attraction and any nearby events you should attend.

Also, if you are logged in to Facebook or Google, 
you can also check your friend's location to catch up with them as well.
